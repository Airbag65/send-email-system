# send-email-system
This is a little system that builds on the login system I have
previously created. To use the system you just simply run the send_mail.py file
in your commandprompt for example (provided you have python installed on your system). 
To add more contacts you simply follow the template in the contacts-txt file, i.e.
type the name of the contact followed by a space and then their email-adress.
